<h1 id="unity-raspberry-pi">Unity Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>I'm attempting training an ai agent in Unity's ml agents that can control a real world robotic car.</p>
<p>This build is based off of an Elegoo arduino kit - https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-smart-robot-car-kit-v-3-0-plus
which is fairly cheap on Amazon.</p>
<p>I'm using a pi zero on the car, which doesn't have enough processing power to run inference, so it has to be controlled remotely. To do this 
I set up a simple web socket server on the pi which can be accessed with websockets plus in Unity c#.</p>
<p>Set the pi ip address to a static address -

<p>Set the camera streaming server and GPIO control server to run on start with a chron job
